  # Caution: Snakemake's --use-conda can cause issues due to nested 
  # conda environments. Rule-specific environments might revert to 
  # environment where Snakemake runs, breaking compatibility with 
  # compiled code tied to specific Python versions.
  # Due to this issue, the following two packages need to be
  # treated as direct dependencies. 
  - pooch           # optional dep of scikit-image
  - paramiko        # optional dep of pooch.
                    # paramiko is actually a indirect dep of snakemake
